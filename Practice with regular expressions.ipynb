    "The Python function `re.fullmatch(pattern_arg, string_arg)` is used to indicate whether or not the  *string* represented by the parameter `string_arg` is in the language that the  *regular expression string* represented by `pattern_arg` generates.  This function either returns a value of `None` if the word is not in the language or, if the word is in the language, a `Match` object that returns the matching string and where the match occurs within the string.  The reasons that this `Match` object has this level of detail is that the `re` library also contains functions that allow one to see if instances of a regular expression are *anywhere within* a string, not just the whole string itself - for those functions, finding both *what matched* and *where it exists* are useful.\n",

There are an infinite number of string in the language generated by this regular expression, but a few examples are `[a, ab, abb, abbb]`, so `abb` should be a match. The results of the comparison are captured in the `result` variable.  By executing the cell below, one can see the `Match` object that is returned indicating that `abb` is in the language generated by the regular expression `ab*`.\n",
